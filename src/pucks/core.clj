;; This is the main program file for pucks. It defines setup and draw functions,
;; which are used by Quil (a.k.a. the Processing library, packaged for Clojure)
;; to set up a simulation. The top-level function, run-pucks, runs a Quil
;; sketch using the provided setup and draw functions. A -main function is
;; also defined so that simulations can be launced from a "lein run" command
;; line.
